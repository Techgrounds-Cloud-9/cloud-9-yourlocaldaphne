# [GitUp] Retro of Week [3]
Scrum master: Give everybody 10 minutes to answer the questions stated below. Then allow them to write them down.

Everybody: Use 10 minutes to answer the given questions. Write the answer down.

Afterwards: Place a copy of this filled out form in your repository.

## What went well?
 - Elena: team work, collaboration, interactive communication.
 - Dominic: Teamwork communications with each other and sharing sources to read from the same pool of information. Building the presentation Daphne knew exactly what it should look like and Elena added and removed some points accordingly, giving me the opportunity to write a file with a summary of the presentation.
 - Daphne: Communication was great, everyone knew what to do and what was expected of. We helped each other out when needed so we all got the finish early.
 - Jair: Called in sick. 

## What could have gone better?
 - Elena: None.
 - Dominic: Blank.
 - Daphne: We had nothing to do when finished early, so we spend a lot of time fine-tuning things which wasn't too necessary.
 - Jair: Called in sick. 

## What can we do to improve?
 - Elena: None.
 - Dominic: No idea.
 - Daphne: My English can be improved, because I sometimes don't know how to explain things thoroughly in English.
 - Jair: Called in sick.
