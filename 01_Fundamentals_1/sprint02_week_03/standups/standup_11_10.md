# Standup Questions

A standup is meant to be held in 15 minutes. The questions below are meant to guide through the process of the standup. Everybody should answer the questions.
 
  - What did you do the last day?
 I finished assignment SEC03, 04 and 05.
  - What are you going to do today?
 I will work on SEC06 and will read through SEC07 and fill in the feedback requests.
  - What are the most pressing issues you are facing? And do you need help?
 None at the moments.

After everybody has answered the questions, the standup is finished. You are now free to address specific issues.
