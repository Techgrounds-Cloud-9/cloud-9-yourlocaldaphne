## Key terminology

- WYSIWYG: WYSIWYG implies a user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the end result while the document is being created.
- WYSIWYM: In a WYSIWYM editor, the user writes the contents in a structured way, marking the content according to its meaning, its significance in the document, and leaves its final appearance up to one or more separate style sheets.

I didn't knew what kind of formatting elements there were so I found a very good sheet that explained all the formatting element options.

### Results
Created a new .md file, edited it with VS code and pushed it to my repository.
