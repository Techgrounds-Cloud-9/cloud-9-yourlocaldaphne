# [ Subnetting ]


## Key terminology
- Subnet: A subnet, or subnetwork, is a segmented piece of a larger network. More specifically, subnets are a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments.
- LAN: A LAN is a group of personal computers and associated equipment that are linked by cable, for example in an office building, and that share a communications line.
- Subnet mask: A subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s and setting network bits to all 1s. In this way, the subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host addresses. The “255” address is always assigned to a broadcast address, and the “0” address is always assigned to a network address.
- CIDR: CIDR notation (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is an alternate method of representing a subnet mask. It is simply a count of the number of network bits (bits that are set to 1) in the subnet mask.
- Network architecture: Network architecture is the design of a computer network. It is a framework for the specification of a network's physical components and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as communication protocols used.
