An IP address is a long string of numbers assigned to every device connected to a network that uses Internet Protocol as the medium for communication.

## Key terminology
- IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the Internet and other packet-switched networks.
- IPv6: IPv6 is the next generation Internet Protocol (IP) address standard intended to supplement and eventually replace IPv4, the protocol many Internet services still use today.
- NAT: Stands for network address translation. Itâ€™s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information.
- Public IPs: is an IP address that can be accessed directly over the internet and is assigned to your network router by your internet service provider.
- Private IPs: In Internet networking, a private network is a computer network that uses a private address space of IP addresses. These addresses are commonly used for local area networks (LANs) in residential, office, and enterprise environments.
- Static address: When a device is assigned a static IP address, the address does not change.
- Dynamic address: A dynamic IP address is an IP address that an ISP lets you use temporarily.
