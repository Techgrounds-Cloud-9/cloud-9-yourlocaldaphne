# [Network Devices]
Name and discribe common network devices. Find the list of all conected devices to your router and find out what other information the router has over all the contected devices. Find out on which DHCP server my network is and it's configurations.

Network devices, or networking hardware, are physical devices that are required for communication and interaction between hardware on a computer network.

## Key terminology
- Network: The linking of computers to allow them to operate interactively.
- Data: Facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.
- Routing: The use of a particular path or direction for something to travel or be placed
- Switching: The practice of directing a signal or data element toward a particular hardware destination.
- Gateways: A computer that sits between different networks or applications.
- OSI: See NTW01_osi_model

### Overcome challenges
I could login to my router because my internet and router are provided by the housing company. I asked my learning coaches what to do and they said I could do the assignment long with a teammate.

### Results

# Name and discribe common network devices:

- Hub
Hubs connect multiple computer networking devices together. A hub also acts as a repeater in that it amplifies signals that deteriorate after traveling long distances over connecting cables. A hub is the simplest in the family of network connecting devices because it connects LAN components with identical protocols.

- Switch
A switch is a multiport device that improves network efficiency. The switch maintains limited routing information about nodes in the internal network, and it allows connections to systems like hubs or routers. Strands of LANs are usually connected using switches. Generally, switches can read the hardware addresses of incoming packets to transmit them to the appropriate destination.

- Router
Routers help transmit packets to their destinations by charting a path through the sea of interconnected networking devices using different network topologies. Routers are intelligent devices, and they store information about the networks they're connected to. Most routers can be configured to operate as packet-filtering firewalls and use access control lists (ACLs). Routers, in conjunction with a channel service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU), are also used to translate from LAN framing to WAN framing. This is needed because LANs and WANs use different network protocols. Such routers are known as border routers. They serve as the outside connection of a LAN to a WAN, and they operate at the border of your network.


- Bridge
Bridges are used to connect two or more hosts or network segments together. The basic role of bridges in network architecture is storing and forwarding frames between the different segments that the bridge connects. They use hardware Media Access Control (MAC) addresses for transferring frames. By looking at the MAC address of the devices connected to each segment, bridges can forward the data or block it from crossing. Bridges can also be used to connect two physical LANs into a larger logical LAN.

- Gateway
Gateways normally work at the Transport and Session layers of the OSI model. At the Transport layer and above, there are numerous protocols and standards from different vendors; gateways are used to deal with them. Gateways provide translation between networking technologies such as Open System Interconnection (OSI) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Because of this, gateways connect two or more autonomous networks, each with its own routing algorithms, protocols, topology, domain name service, and network administration procedures and policies.

- Modem
Modems (modulators-demodulators) are used to transmit digital signals over analog telephone lines. Thus, digital signals are converted by the modem into analog signals of different frequencies and transmitted to a modem at the receiving location. The receiving modem performs the reverse transformation and provides a digital output to a device connected to a modem, usually a computer.

- Repeater
A repeater is an electronic device that amplifies the signal it receives. You can think of repeater as a device which receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level or higher power so that the signal can cover longer distances, more than 100 meters for standard LAN cables. Repeaters work on the Physical layer.


- Access Point
While an access point (AP) can technically involve either a wired or wireless connection, it commonly means a wireless device. An AP works at the second OSI layer, the Data Link layer, and it can operate either as a bridge connecting a standard wired network to wireless devices or as a router passing data transmissions from one access point to another.
