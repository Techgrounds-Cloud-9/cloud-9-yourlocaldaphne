# Standup Questions

A standup is meant to be held in 15 minutes. The questions below are meant to guide through the process of the standup. Everybody should answer the questions.

  - What did you do the last day?
   Finished working on NTW01, 02, 03 and made a small start on NTW04. Also filled out the exercise format for every finished assignment. Successfully timeboxed.
  - What are you going to do today?
  Finish assignment NTW04 and NTW05, if time allows I will also work on the assignments after NTW05. 
  - What are the most pressing issues you are facing? And do you need help?
  Yesterday I faced the issue that I don't have admin access to my router so I couldn't finish NTW03 by myself. For exercise NTW05 I also need admin access to my router so I'll have to ask a teammate to do the assignment along with them.

After everybody has answered the questions, the standup is finished. You are now free to address specific issues.
