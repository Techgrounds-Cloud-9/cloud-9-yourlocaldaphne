# Standup Questions

A standup is meant to be held in 15 minutes. The questions below are meant to guide through the process of the standup. Everybody should answer the questions.

  - What did you do the last day?
   Made a small messay/script for the presentation on Friday, made the slides for the presentation and filled in the retro.
  - What are you going to do today?
  Read through the assignments, see how much time I think I would need for each to estimate if I will finish everything on time or need extra help. Try time boxing for each assignment. Start on the first assignment.
  - What are the most pressing issues you are facing? And do you need help?
  No issues at the moment since we just started

After everybody has answered the questions, the standup is finished. You are now free to address specific issues.
