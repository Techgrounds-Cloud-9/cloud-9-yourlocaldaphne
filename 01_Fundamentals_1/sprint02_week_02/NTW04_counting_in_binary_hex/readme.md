# [Counting in Binary and Hex]
Binary number systems use a base of two while hexadecimal uses a base of 16. In a hexadecimal system, it is necessary to count to 15. To represent the numbers 10 – 15, the letters A – F are used.

## Key terminology
- Binary: A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" and "1".
- Hex: Or hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters "A", "B", "C", "D", "E" and "F".
- Decimal: Decimal is a term that describes the base-10 number system, the most commonly used number system.
