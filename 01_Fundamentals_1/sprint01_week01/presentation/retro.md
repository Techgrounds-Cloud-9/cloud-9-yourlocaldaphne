## What went well?
 - Time managment went well, at day 2 I had a good indication of when I would finish certain tasks. This way I knew when to move on to the next assignment.

## What could have gone better?
 - File management could be better, I think I'll have problems finding standup and retro files later on.

## What can we do to improve?
 - Making a new directory for standup and retro files specific.
