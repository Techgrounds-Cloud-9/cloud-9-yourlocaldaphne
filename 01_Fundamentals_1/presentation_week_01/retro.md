## What went well?
 - Time managment went well, at day 2 I had a good indication of when I would finish certain tasks. This way I knew when to move on to the next assignment.

## What could have gone better?
 - We took a little long on some discussions.
 - Sometimes when I tried to explain things I got talked over.

## What can we do to improve?
 - We could use a new way of staying on topic for some discussions so we don't stay on things for too long.
