# Standup Questions

A standup is meant to be held in 15 minutes. The questions below are meant to guide through the process of the standup. Everybody should answer the questions.
 
  - What did you do the last day?\
Last time I was not attending the course due to tooth. I did manage to finish the last assignments from the previous sprint but I still need to document.
  - What are you going to do today?\
I'm doing to document the previous sprint assignments, and work on the first assignment of this sprint.
  - What are the most pressing issues you are facing? And do you need help?\
 The only issue I have is that I'm a little behind schedule but I think I can manage to get everything done by the end of the week.


After everybody has answered the questions, the standup is finished. You are now free to address specific issues.
