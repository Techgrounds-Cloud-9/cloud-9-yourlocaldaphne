# Standup Questions

A standup is meant to be held in 15 minutes. The questions below are meant to guide through the process of the standup. Everybody should answer the questions.
 
  - What did you do the last day?\
I was sick yesterday.
  - What are you going to do today?\
I will ask my peers about updates that I might have missed yesterday and work on the new assignments.
  - What are the most pressing issues you are facing? And do you need help?\
  The accounts for Azure still need certain permissions, I can't work on certain assignments because of that. I will continue working on assignments that don't need Azure.


After everybody has answered the questions, the standup is finished. You are now free to address specific issues.
