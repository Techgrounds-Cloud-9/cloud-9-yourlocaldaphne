# [ Global Infrastructure ]
Learning and researching about Azure's global infrastructure and it's components.

## Key terminology
- Cloud: "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.
- Servers: A server stores, sends, and receives data. In essence, it "serves" something else and exists to provide services. A computer, software program, or even a storage device may act as a server, and it may provide one service or several.
- Networking: Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other. These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies.
- Physical infrastructure: Physical infrastructure includes power, backup generators, Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning, surge control systems, connectivity (cabling), hardware, software, and people. The physical systems are vulnerable to surveillance, vandalism, sabotage, and attack.
- Virtual infrastructure: A virtual infrastructure provides the same IT capabilities as physical resources, but with software, so that IT teams can allocate these virtual resources quickly and across multiple systems, based on the varying needs of the enterprise.
- Azure subscriptions: An Azure subscription is tied to a single account, the one that was used to create it and is also used for billing. Resources can be supplied as instances of the many Azure products and services under the subscription. Free, pay-as-you-go, and member offers are the three primary types of subscriptions accessible.
