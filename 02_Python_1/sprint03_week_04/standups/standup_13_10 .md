# Standup Questions

A standup is meant to be held in 15 minutes. The questions below are meant to guide through the process of the standup. Everybody should answer the questions.
 
  - What did you do the last day?
I have worked on SEC08 and filled out everyone's feedback request.
  - What are you going to do today?
For this sprint/week there are 9 assignments, I will aim to finish 2 to 3 assignment per day to stay on schedule. So for today I will work on PRG 01, 02 and if I have time left 03.
  - What are the most pressing issues you are facing? And do you need help?
 None at the moment other then the fact that I don't know much about Python yet.

After everybody has answered the questions, the standup is finished. You are now free to address specific issues.
