# Standup Questions

A standup is meant to be held in 15 minutes. The questions below are meant to guide through the process of the standup. Everybody should answer the questions.
 
  - What did you do the last day?
I had a job interview at Kyndryl.
  - What are you going to do today?
Today I will finish exercise PRG04 and 05, when I have enough time I will also start on 06.
  - What are the most pressing issues you are facing? And do you need help?
 I'm a little behind my planned out schedule because of the job interview but if I work hard I will still be able to finish the assignments on time.

After everybody has answered the questions, the standup is finished. You are now free to address specific issues.
