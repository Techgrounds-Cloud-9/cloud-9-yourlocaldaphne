## Exercise

Exercise 1:
- Create a new script.
- Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
- Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

Exercise 2:
- Create a new script.
- Copy the code below into your script.\
 `for i in range(10):`\
`# do something here`
- Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
- Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

Exercise 3:
- Create a new script.
- Copy the array below into your script.
`arr = ["Coen", "Casper", "Joshua", "Abdessamad", "Saskia"]`
- Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
